## Robotex Mind Control

Sample Application made for Robotex's Mind Control competitions.

### Features

* Written in Kotlin, Android's new first-level development language
* Connection to [Muse brain sensing headband](http://www.choosemuse.com/)
* Basic networking logic to send commands to your Raspberry Pi
* Option to manually control your robot
* Graph view of EEG data
* Graph view of accelerometer data for testing purposes, not allowed when competing

### What it lacks

* There is no direct link to send data to the Raspberry from EEG data results
* Proper documentation â€“ this is partly because I'm lazy, but partly also so your life wouldn't be too easy. You need to figure some things out for yourselves.
